True love is the answer to everything.

A tribute to Nathan and Nora from *Upload*, to the two young men in love beneath the dormitory, and to emotions that are complex and real.

Not every affection must lead to a happy ending, but may every sincere feeling be expressed and shared without limit ❤️. No hardship can ever stop the growth of spiritual faith 🌷.
