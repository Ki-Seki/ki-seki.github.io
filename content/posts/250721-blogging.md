I used to blog for a while, but mostly just study notes. Now I plan to start blogging again, preferring to write in-depth long articles, especially in research and life experiences.

The future of research won't belong to the peer-review system‚Äîwhich is already crumbling, in my view. Plus, blogging has become an integral part of academic discourse; for instance, ICLR introduced blog post tracks in 2021 [^Gauthier].

So, I hope to create cool stuff, write fascinating content, and hopefully catch your attention through blogging. üåü
